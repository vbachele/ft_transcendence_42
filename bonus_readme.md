### Some advices
You should agree to have a harmonized design: 
- having only 2 main colors colors for your visual identities (for us it was orange and black).
- One button to rule them all + some declinations of this one.
- Only one font family for all the website.
- SVG files for your images as this you can change the color and the size really easily.
- For your width, height etc... take always aa multiple of 8 (this is a rule from real designer).
