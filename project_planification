### How did we planify the project

Not an easy task to begin transcendence, there are so much to do!! But here what our group did good and what we did wrong.
#### What we did good

1. Features for the website
We begin by discussing about who wants to do what then we divided the project into features the :
  - Chat
  - Pong 
  - Auth
  - leaderboard/friends

2. The design (UI/UX).
We took more than a week to do a design according to what it is asked to the subject + what will be a good user experience. When doing the design, we did the responsive (design for mobile and laptop) to be sure we can enjoy our website on our smartphone.
  
3. We began by the frontend
In order to be all at the same page and to share our problematics, we worked on the front (REACT) to begin for around 2 months, then we plugged our front to the backend. 

4. Project management on github
We created a project in our github repo to used a ticket system.

5. Daily meeting to share our work
Every work day at 1:30 PM, we used to connect on discord, shared our work, our problematics and be sure we are going to the same direction

#### What we did wrong

1. Too much time to begin to code
We took 2 weeks to watch tutorial, it is so looonng and we had a loss of motivation. 

2. No real code review
We should have done code review when someone push his code to the main in order to understand better what he is doing, learn how to explain and improve the code.

3. Better timing estimation for each feature
Some features were really hard to estimate like the chat and we lost at least 2 weeks to finish it.

4. No automatical test 
More and more you go deeper to the project and more changing an existing feature can fuck another part of your code. Best you can do it is running automatical test on your existing feature to be sure your code is reliable and functional.
